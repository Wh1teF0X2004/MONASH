    "Parallelism of join queries is achieved through data parallelism, whereby the same task is applied to different parts of the data. That is, after data partitioning has been completed, each processor will have its own data to work with. Thus, each processor will apply **any serial join algorithm**. Once this is carried out in each processor, the final results of the join operation are consolidated from the results obtained from different processors. \n",

    "### 2.1 Divide and Broadcast-Based Parallel Join Algorithms ###\n",
    "These algorithms consist of two stages: (1) data partitioning using the divide and broadcast method and (2) a local join. \n",
    "\n",
    "The divide and broadcast data partitioning method consists of dividing one table into multiple disjoint partitions, where each partition is allocated a processor, and broadcasts the other table to all available processors. Dividing one table may be done simply by using equal division, so that each partition will have the same size, whereas broadcasting is actually replicating the content of the second table to all processors. Thus it is preferable for the smaller table to be broadcast and the larger table to be divided.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise**: Understand how a divide and broadcast-based parallel join algorithms works given the tables R and S above. We assume that **the  hash-based join algorithm (i.e. `HB_join(.)`)** are used (see the above) and **the round-robin data partitioning** function that designed for \"Parallel Search\" acitivity (i.e. see below: **`rr_partition(.)`**) is used to implement this parallel join algorithm. Also, we assume that we use a shared-memory architecture is used, so there is no replication of the broadcast table S."
