    "# Parsing PDF Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Portable Document Format ([PDF](https://acrobat.adobe.com/au/en/products/about-adobe-pdf.html)), invented by Adobe, is \"*a file format used to present and exchange documents reliably, independent of software, hardware, or operating system.*\" It is a great format for representing digital documents since each PDF file encapsulates a complete description of the layout of the original document (i.e., the text, fonts, graphics, and other meta information of the document). However, it’s a document representation format and not a data format that is machine readable, like CSV, JSON, and XML. Unfortunately, much of real world data is stored in PDF files, particularly the data published by some government agencies and finance institutions. \n",
    "Here we would also like to point out that if you can avoid having to extract\n",
    "data from PDFs, you should.\n",
    "\n",
    "For data analysis, PDF is not a preferred storage or presentation format. However, sometimes we do not have any other choice. Throughout this chapter, you are going to learn two different ways of scraping data from PDFs with examples. We will cover how to write your own Python scripts, how to use some existing tools, and finally how to save the parsed data into a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example used in this chapter is \"[Table 2: Nutrition](http://www.unicef.org/sowc2014/numbers/documents/english/EN-FINAL%20Table%202.pdf)\" from Unicef's report on [The State of the Worlds Children](http://www.unicef.org/sowc2014/numbers/) for 2014. Click the link to download the pdf file, named \"EN-FINAL Table 2.pdf\" and save it into the same folder as where you stored this notebook. It is the same data as that used in the previous chapter, but in PDF format. The following screenshot shows what the the first page of the PDF file looks like. \n",

    "\n",
    "PDFs are more difficult to work with than Excel files because different PDFs can have different formats that are unpredictable. For those curious why it is so difficult to extract data from PDFs, you might be interested in reading the story from [ProPublica](https://www.propublica.org/nerds/item/heart-of-nerd-darkness-why-dollars-for-docs-was-so-difficult) (Read Section \"PDFs Considered Harmful\" 📖 ). There are many ways of extracting data from PDFs. Just to name a few, here is a list of tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "* [pdfminer](http://www.unixuser.org/~euske/python/pdfminer/): A tool for extracting text, images, object coordinates, metadata from PDF documents. It includes a PDF converter and an extensible PDF parser. \n",
    "* [pdftables](https://github.com/chrisdev/pdftables): A tool for extracting tables from PDF files, it uses pdfminer to get information on the locations of text elements. Each row in the table is extracted and stored in a list.\n",
    "* [slate](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/slate): A Python package that simplifies the process of extracting text from PDF files. It is a small Python module that wraps pdfminer's API.\n",
    "* [PyPDF2](http://mstamy2.github.io/PyPDF2/): A Python library built for manipulating PDFs, such as extracting document information, splitting, merging, and cropping pages, etc.\n",
    "* [Tabula](http://tabula.technology/): A simple tool for extracting data tables out of PDF files. It is quite simple to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Try to find more tools on Internet! Note that you should search for PDF parsing tools that are capable of extracting data from PDFs, as some parsing tools are not suitable for data extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Besides these tools, you can also scrape data from PDF files with many programming languages, like Python. After searching for online tutorials, documentation, and blog post, such as \n",
    "* [Get Started With Scraping – Extracting Simple Tables from PDF Documents](http://schoolofdata.org/2013/06/18/get-started-with-scraping-extracting-simple-tables-from-pdf-documents/) 📖 . It dicusses how to use pdftohtml to extract tables from PDFs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we will demonstrate <font color = \"red\"> how to use pdfminder and pdftables to extract data tables out from the downloaded PDF file </font> and save the extracted data into a CSV file.\n",

    "## 1. Scraping data from PDFs with PDFMiner\n",
    "We start with a crude approach in which one first converts PDF to text, and then extracts data for the text using, for example, regular expression. \n",
    "This approach is better if you have a very large PDF file or a series of PDF files that corresponds to a set of consistent documents. We will also show the drawbacks of this approach later in this section. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Converting PDF to Text\n",
    "To convert the downloaded PDF file to a text file, we are going to use *pdf2txt.py*, a command that comes with pdfminer. Let's install pdfminer. In your command line window, type either of the following scripts:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "    pip install pdfminer.six==20181108\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now we have pdfminer installed and are ready to convert our PDF to text by running the following command:\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "   pdf2txt.py -o en_final_table_2.txt EN_FINAL_Table_2.pdf\n",
    "```\n",
    "The argument `-o` is the text file we want to create, the second argument is the PDF file that we want to convert. After running the above command, we have a text version of the PDF file, i.e., `en_final_table_2.txt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a moment to skim the txt file and the original PDF file, and have a comparison. What do you find? \n",
    "\n",
    "The text file is quite messy. All the tables have been converted into text form, and the nice table layout shown in the PDF file is lost. Now how can we extract data tables and reconstruct the layout? In the following section, you will learn how to gradually develop a Python script for scraping data from our converted text file. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's read the new text file into python."

To do so, let's open up the text file, i.e., `en_final_table_2.txt`, and search for blocks of text that contain country names. Can you identify any pattern?\n",

This Boolean variable should be set to `True` when we hit the \"and areas\" line, and to `false` when we hit the line containing only a new line character. We then update our python script with the Boolean variable accordingly."

    "\n",
    "Extracting the table columns is not as easy as collecting the country names. Scanning the text file, you will find that you cannot simply create a Boolean variable, as there are no patterns that can be used to identify the start and the end of each column on each PDF page. All columns on the same PDF page are stacked together and interleaved with either text or line breaks. \n",
    "\n",
    "How can we extract the data in columns and recover the table structure? \n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, it looks like `pdf2txt.py` extracted the data from our PDF file in a column-wise way. Each cell in our PDF was extracted as one line in the text file; and cells were stacked according to the linear layout of the table on each page. If we are able to extract all the cell values in order and know the number of records and the number of columns on each page, we might then be able to unstack all the cells and put them into a tabular format. \n",
    "\n",
    "Getting the number of columns in the PDF table is easy. Manually counting the number of columns, you will get the number 12. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let's count the number of records on each PDF page. Since we have written the script to collect all the country names from each PDF page, it should be easy to compute the number of records on each page by inserting a count variable into the same script. Let the count variable be `numRec`. While the script hits the line starting with 'and areas', we set `numRec` to zero. We then increase `numRec` by one every time we successfully retrieve a name until the script hits the end of the name block. Let's insert this logic into the script and save the counts in a list, `recordsPerPage`."

    "## 2. Scraping data from PDFs with  pdftables\n",
    " \n",
    "After scratching our heads at the complexity shown in the approach of using 'pdf2txt.py'. We started searching for\n",
    "other tools or libraries that <font color = \"red\"> make use of information on the locations of text elements in a PDF document </font>. We came across a Python library, called pdftables. In this section, you will learn how to use pdftables to extract data from our PDF files. To install this library, use the following command\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "    pip install pdftables.six\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that installing pdftables might downgrade your numpy version, which could cause Pandas to fail. In this case,\n",
    "you need to upgrade your numpy after installing pdftables. We should mention that the drawback of using pdftables \n",
    "is that its developers do not maintain proper documentation. Hence you might need to look at the source code to\n",
    "figure out the functions that you are going to use. Nevertheless, it is a good tool for extracting data tables from\n",
    "PDFs. You will eventually find that the all-in-one function that you are going to use to get the data is\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    pdftables.get_tables()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will use the same PDF file as we used in the previous section to demonstrate how to use pdftables to scrape all the tables from that PDF file. Let's start with loading our PDF with the `get_tables()` function."
