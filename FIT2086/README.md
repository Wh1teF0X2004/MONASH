## Statistical Modelling Foundations in Data Science
This unit delves into the statistical modelling principles essential for the analytical dimensions of Data Science. The curriculum encompasses:

- **Data Handling**: Techniques for data collection and sampling, along with ensuring data quality.
- **Analytic Techniques**: Approaches to statistical hypothesis testing, and both exploratory and confirmatory analyses.
- **Probability Distributions**: Concepts of dependence and independence, analysis of multivariate Gaussian, Poisson, and Dirichlet distributions, alongside methods for random number generation and distribution simulation, including sample simulation via bootstrapping.
- **Predictive Modelling**: Development of linear and logistic regression models, as well as Bayesian classification approaches.
- **Estimation Methods**: Strategies for parameter and function estimation, including maximum likelihood and minimum cost estimators, Monte Carlo estimators, applications of inverse probabilities and Bayes theorem, considerations of bias versus variance, sample size implications, cross-validation techniques, and methods for estimating model performance.
