## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Run R Script Code

```{r fibonacci}
# Function to print Fibonacci sequence up to n terms
fibonacci <- function(n) {
  # Initialize variables to store the first two terms of the sequence
  a <- 0
  b <- 1
  
  # Print the first two terms
  cat(a, b, sep = ", ")
  
  # Generate and print the remaining terms
  for (i in 3:n) {
    c <- a + b
    cat(", ", c)
    # Update variables for the next iteration
    a <- b
    b <- c
  }
}

# Define the number of terms you want in the sequence
n <- 10
# Call the function to print Fibonacci sequence up to n terms
fibonacci(n)

plot(1:n, fibonacci(n), type="b", 
     main = "Fibonacci Series",
     xlab = "Index",
     ylab = "Value")
```
