Out of the seven ancient wonders of the world, only the Great Pyramids of Giza still stand. The rest have been destroyed either by earthquakes or fire. The Hanging Gardens of Babylon were constructed near the Euphrates River in modern-day Iraq by the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar II around 600 B.C. The Original 7 wonders of the world of the ancient time are: 
Great Pyramid of Giza – Egypt
Hanging Gardens of Babylon – Ancient Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq)
Statue of Zeus at Olympia – Greece
Temple of Artemis at Ephesus – Turkey

According to ancient Greek poets, the gardens were planted as high as 75 feet in the air on a massive square brick terrace. The New 7 Wonders Foundation was established in 2001 by Bernard Weber, a Swiss-born Canadian filmmaker, author, and adventurer. The foundation’s mission is to safeguard the world’s human-built and natural heritage.
