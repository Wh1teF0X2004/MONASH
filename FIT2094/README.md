# FIT2094/FIT3171 - DATABASES
- Class 2023 Semester 1
- Assessment 1a (10%): Conceptual Design
- Assessment 1b (30%): Logical Design (Relational)
- Assessment 2a (25%): Relational Database Implementation and Manipulation
- Assessment 2b (35%): Relational and Non Relational Database Query and PL/SQL

## Assessment 1
- Group Assessment
- Assessment 1a: Apply the theories of the relational database model and develop a sound relational database design
- Assessment 1b: Apply the theories of the relational database model, develop a sound relational database design and finally implement a relational database based on a sound database design

## Assessment 2
- Individual Assessment
- Assessment 2a: Apply the theories of the relational database model, implement a relational database based on a sound database design, and manage data that meets user requirements, including queries and transactions
  - Implement, via SQL, a small database in the Oracle RDBMS from a provided logical model case study, followed by the insert of appropriate data to the created tables. Once populated the database will be used to: carry out specified DML commands and make specified changes to the database structure via SQL. As part of the assignment, students will need to submit an SQL Portfolio task and maintain history of the development on the FIT GitLab server
- Assessment 2b: Apply the theories of the relational database model, manage data that meets user requirements, including queries and transactions, and contrast the differences between non-relational database models and the relational database model
  - Use SQL and NoSQL to write queries to produce specified output. As part of the assignment, students will need to submit weekly SQL Portfolio tasks and maintain history of the development on the FIT GitLab server
