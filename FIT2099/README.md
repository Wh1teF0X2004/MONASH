# FIT2099 - OBJECT ORIENTED DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION
- Class 2023 Semester 1
- On successful completion of this unit, you should be able to:
    - Iteratively apply object-oriented design principles to design small to medium-size software systems, using standard software engineering notations, namely UML class diagrams and UML interaction diagrams
    - Describe the quality of object-oriented software designs, both in terms of meeting user requirements and the effective application of object-oriented design concepts and principles
    - Apply object-oriented programming constructs, such as abstraction, information hiding, inheritance, and polymorphism, to implement object-oriented designs using a programming language (namely, Java)
    - Apply effective programming strategies to refactor and debug object-oriented implementations systematically and efficiently by using available programming language tools
    - Apply principles of software engineering practice to create object-oriented systems with peers using tools including integrated development environments (IDEs), UML drawing tools, and version control systems
- Technologies Used: EdStem, IntelliJ IDEA, Microsoft Words/Google Docs, GitLab (Git)

## About Assessment Theme
- You will be working on a text-based "rogue-like" game
    - Rogue-like games are named after the first such program: a fantasy game named rogue
    - They were very popular in the days before home computers were capable of elaborate graphics and still have a small but dedicated following
    - If you would like more information about roguelike games, a good site is http://www.roguebasin.com/
- As it stands, the game functions, but is missing a lot of desired functionality. Over the course of this project, you will incrementally add new features to the game
    - You will be expected to design some new features in Assignment 1, and then implement them in Assignment 2
    - In Assignment 3, you will both design and implement another set of features
- In this assignment, we are inspired by **Elden Ring**
    - We may use several similar names (characters, items, locations) and concepts. The purpose of using an actual game’s concepts is to help you visualise the required features. We also believe that using actual game references can bring fun while working on the assignments
    - All of the linked game contents, videos, and images belong to the respective owners and are subject to copyright. We mainly use the concepts for educational purposes and provide credit to the original creators accordingly. We may also add, alter, and reduce the original content and features to make them more suitable to the game engine, unit outcomes, and assignments’ time frame
    - In this game, you will play as Tarnished (@) to explore The Lands Between, where the event of Elden Ring takes place!
