1. When Lisel created the Participants table for the event participants, she used the Access default primary key field, which is typically named "ID." So, the primary key field in the Participants table is likely named "ID."

2. Laquan, who needs to view data that uses fields from both the Vendor table and the Venue table, should use an Access query to create the most concise list of vendors, vendor contact information, and assigned tent spaces. A query allows you to retrieve specific data from one or more tables, apply filters, and combine fields from different tables. In this case, Laquan can create a query that joins the Vendor and Venue tables based on a common field (such as TentNumber) and selects the desired fields (Vendor Name, Vendor Contact Information, Venue Space Assigned). This will provide a concise list of vendors with their assigned tent spaces.

3. Based on the table descriptions, the field that might be used to create a relationship between the Vendors and Venue tables is likely "Venue Space Assigned" in the Vendors table and "TentNumber" in the Venue table. These fields appear to be related as they both reference the assigned spaces for vendors. Creating a relationship between these two fields would allow you to link vendors to their assigned tent spaces.
