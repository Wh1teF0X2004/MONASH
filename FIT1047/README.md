## Assessment 1
- Individual Assignment
- This assignment requires students to reflect on different ways to represent numbers, and to convert a Boolean truth table into Boolean formulas and optimised circuits

## Assessment 2
- Individual Assignment
- This assignment has two parts
  - In part 1, students analyse and describe the processes that are running on their computer
  - In part 2, students solve a MARIE programming task, demonstrating concepts such as direct/indirect jumps and loads, conditionals and loops, and encoding data into memory
 
## Assessment 3
- Individual Assignment
- This assignment requires students to analyse a real-world wireless network
- Students map the network coverage and identify potential network quality problems
  - In addition, students analyse captured network traffic and determine information about the used protocols and standards

## Assessment 3
- Individual Assignment
- This assignment requires students to understand and analyse a recent cybersecurity vulnerability or incident, research the background
- Students are expected to write a report discussing potential consequences and mitigation and record a presentation
  - Students would also need to analyse and explain how the issues can be mitigated
