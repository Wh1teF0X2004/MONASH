# ETW3482 - DATA MINING AND PREDICTIVE MODELLING
- Class 2024 Semester 2
- Chief Examiner: Ganeshsree Selvachandran, Dr. Lee How Chinh
- Assessment 1 (20%)
- Assessment 2 (40%)
- Assessment 3 (40%)
- Technologies Used: SAS Viya (Tied with student email)

## Assessment 1
- Individual Assessment
- Predictive Modelling Project Proposal
- Select a suitable data set for the predictive modelling and prepare a predictive modelling project proposal based on the selected data
- Selected data: CARDATA-SAS7BDAT

## Assessment 2
- Individual Assessment
- Predictive Modelling Project
- Objective(s):
  - Apply predictive modelling knowledge to a real-world business scenario based on previously selected datasets with binary targets and prepare an industrial-format technical report for a data analytics manager to evaluate its relevancy, significance, reliability and data integrity
- Assessment Description:
  - A suitable dataset has been previously identified for a predictive modelling task with a binary target and have prepared a proposal outlining the intended approach
  - Building on this proposal, a predictive modelling project will be developed using SAS Viya Model Studio and write a technical report detailing the predictive modelling process

## Assessment 3
- Individual Assessment
- Model Assessment Assignment
- Objective(s):
  - Evaluate and compare the performance of the models built
  - Produce conclusions and decisions based on model predictions
